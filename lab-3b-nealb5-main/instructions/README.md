# Lab 3B - PHP Part 2

## Overview

In the previous lab, we had you set up basic authentication for your application, but to really understand PHP, we're going to have you "transpile" your client-side javascript code from lab 2 into server-side PHP.

This lab builds off the previous labs (as do all of the labs), so make sure you organize and add comments to your code well so you will be able to read and understand it again later. At the end of this lab, there should be almost no JavaScript in your project. You should modify the JavaScript to live-capture the form data and submit it when the user adds a task. You may also keep any JavaScript to display completed tasks differently, i.e. linethrough or color change, if you used that previously. You should also keep any JavaScript to initialize any Date Picker if you used that previously. All other functionality should be implemented in PHP.

> Note: When copying over your files from Lab 3A do not just copy over all the files. If you accidentally copy over the hidden .git folder the remote origin of your Lab 3B folder will change and all your work will be pushed to your Lab 3A repository and not your Lab 3B repository.

### Assignments

Lab Write-Up Instructions are in the "Content" tab in Learning Suite.

## Instructions

#### For MAC USERS with ARM processors
We have an alternative docker-compose file for those running M1 and M2 based Macs. Since it uses native ARM code it performs better on those computers though the other works due to Intel emulation on MacOS. To use the alternate, rename `docker-compose-ARM.yml` to `docker-compose.yml`.

### Step 1: UML

Read the entire lab, and create a UML diagram of all the interactions including CRUD functions and checking if the user is logged in with swim lanes before you start coding. This diagram should follow the same rules as HW4:
- 4 Swim Lanes:
   - User
   - Browser
   - Server
   - Database
- One Start and one end circle
- Decisions in diamonds, formed as questions and the branches are labeled
- There should NOT be any decisions in the Database
- The layout should be clear and legible, arrows don't overlap, and go in one direction.

### Step 2: Database Setup

#### Production Environment

1. Using PHPMyAdmin on your Production Environment (`HTTP://<aws-ip-address>/phpmyadmin`), create a new table called `task` in the `lab_3` database using the following fields:

      | Name      | Type      | Index     | ... | A_I | ... |
      | --------- | --------- | --------- | --- | --- | --- |
      | `id`      | `INT`     | `PRIMARY` | ... | ☒   | ... |
      | `user_id` | `INT`     |           | ... | ☐   | ... |
      | `text`    | `TEXT`    |           | ... | ☐   | ... |
      | `date`    | `DATE`    |           | ... | ☐   | ... |
      | `done`    | `BOOLEAN` |           | ... | ☐   | ... |

      > Note: The MariaDB DATE type is just a varchar that gets validated upon submission.
      
      > Tip: If using Type TEXT gives you problems, you can use VARCHAR instead with an appropriately long max length value for a task’s text property.

2. Using PHPMyAdmin or the MariaDB CLI, add a few tasks so you have some data to work with. Make sure the `user_id` field matches a user that already exists in your database.

#### Development Environment

1. Using PHPMyAdmin on your Development Environment ([`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080)), follow the same steps as above

   > IMPORTANT: When stopping your docker containers, sometimes you'll want to delete the volume associated with `mariadb` (where your MariaDB database lives) using `docker-compose down -v` or `docker-compose down --volumes`. If you do this, all of the changes you made to your database will be gone. Adding the `--volumes` flag will remove your `user` table and your `task` table forever. It's not super hard to re-create them, but it might be annoying.

### Step 3: Transpile

> Because of the differences in where the code is run, and the difficulties in reproducing functionalities because of that, it becomes *very difficult* to get an automatic transpiler to convert from JavaScript to PHP. We want to copy over the general functionality, not all of the logic. DO NOT try and have your code automatically transpiled, *it will not work*.

1. Create

   - You should already have a form to create tasks from a previous lab. You will be handling the form with PHP instead of JS so make sure you remove any event listeners associated with this form.
   - If you've organized your `_action.php` files into an `actions` folder, add a new file called `create_action.php`, and set the `action` attribute of the `<form>` tag to reference it
   - Your action file needs to accomplish the following tasks:
     - Read the values passed from the form
     - Grab the id of the current user from the session (you should be saving the `user_id` to the session when a user logs in or registers)
     - Create a new task in the database using the form data and the user's id
     - Redirect back to `index.php` on success

2. Read

      - In your `index.php` file in the root of your project, do the following:
      - Connect to your MariaDB database and query for tasks that match the current user's `id` with the task's `user_id` field
      - As you've done in JavaScript, print a new task to the page for each result from the query
         > TIP: it may be helpful to define a function that accepts the details of a task and then prints them out, and call that for each task.

3. Update

   - If your checkbox isn't already in a form, wrap a `<form>` tag and a `<button type="submit">` tag around it
   - Create a new action file called `update_action.php`
   - Pass the task's `id` with the rest of the form when you submit it

      > TIP: You can accomplish this with a hidden `<input>` tag who's value is the tasks's `id`
      > TIP: Make sure to apply the correct CSS classes to the form to make the style consistent with Lab 2

   - Your action file needs to accomplish the following tasks:
     1. Read the values passed from the form
     2. Update the task in the database based on the passed values
     3. Redirect back to `index.php` if the update succeeds
    > HINT: Use a material icon for the button

4. Delete

   - Wrap your delete button in a `<form>` tag
     - If your delete button is an actual `<button>` tag, change the type to `type="submit"`
     - Otherwise, wrap the element that contains your delete button in a new `<button type="submit">` tag
     > TIP: Make sure to apply the correct CSS classes to the form to make the style consistent with Lab 2
   - Create a new action file called `delete_action.php`
   - As with `update_action.php`, pass the user's `id` with the rest of the form when you submit it
   - Your action file needs to accomplish the following tasks:
     1. Read the values passed from the form
     2. Delete the task from the database using the values you get from the `<form>`
     3. Redirect back to `index.php` if the delete succeeds

### Step 4: General Requirements

1. All your forms should utilize the appropriate HTTP method for its action ("post" or "get")

2. Any SQL statement that uses user-provided input should use Prepared Statements to interact with the database

3. Your website should look neat and tidy, with no text against the edge of the screen

   > HINT: You can use the `container` CSS class that comes with Bootstrap to automatically change the size of your content based on screen width!

4. Your `<nav>` element should have no other elements above it, span the entire width of the screen

5. When there is no user logged in, your home page should automatically re-direct you to the login screen

6. You should be able to switch back and forth between the login page and the register page when you're on it

7. When logged in, there should be a <kbd>Log Out</kbd> button on the `<nav>` bar in an appropriate location

8. The only `<script>` tag on your website should be the one that imports your CSS framework's JavaScript files.

9. Use a checkbox material icon on a button for the checkbox instead of the standard checkbox input tag so the checkbox can be used as a submit button for updating a task.

# Tips

## How do I...?

Besides the resources listed at the beginning of this document, Google will be your best friend for this lab. For example you might search "PHP get form data from GET request", or "HTML hidden input", etc.

## var_dump()

In PHP there is a way to nicely print out any type of variable and it is var_dump(). This means you can give it an int, string, array, or object and it will print it out for you. This can be useful when working with results from your database.
